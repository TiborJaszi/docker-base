# Woohoo Labs. Docker Base Images

## Usage

You can use the `build.sh` script in order to build images by passing the image name and version numbers as arguments.
For example

```bash
./build.sh php 4 0 0
```

The script will then build the "woohoolabs/php:4.0.0" image. If you are satisfied with the result, you can choose to
publish it to Docker Hub by simply answering "y" to the question.
